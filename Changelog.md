## v3.4.1

### Minor Improvements
- **New Fleet Overview screen** on the MFD Extended BMS bay: press the BMS button again while on the main battery screen to see every RealBattery-equipped vessel in the save at a glance — charge, net rate, time-to-empty, and whether the reading is live or an estimate for a vessel that's out of physics range — sorted alphabetically, with your own ship pinned at the top. Press BMS again to return to the main screen.
- **List scrolling** on both BMS screens: the monitor's UP/DOWN/HOME keys now scroll long battery or fleet lists, with a status line at the bottom showing your position and a key reminder.
- Long vessel names that don't fit their column now scroll across instead of being cut off.
- Charge-level colors on the Fleet Overview now match the same low/critical bands used by VesselViewer EFIS's fuel gauges, for a consistent reading across screens.
- The remaining-time column turns amber inside the low-power alarm's own lead time and disappears once actually at zero, instead of sitting on a permanent 00m:00s.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a vessel that leaves physics range (e.g. a jettisoned stage drifting away) disappearing from the Fleet Overview entirely instead of showing as an estimate, as long as no scene change or save happened in between.
- Fixed the status line at the bottom of both BMS screens floating up against the last row of content instead of staying anchored to the bottom of the screen when a list was short.

## v3.4.0

### Minor Improvements
- **MFD Extended bay now shows real vessel data** (previously a hello-world placeholder, see v3.3.4): the bay (renamed **BMS** on the MFD Extended host side) displays live autonomy (time until the first battery pack in the vessel actually depletes, not a crude vessel-wide average that means nothing when packs have very different C-rates), net rate (auto-scaling W/kW/MW/GW), reserve (physical total kWh, auto-scaling Wh/kWh/MWh/GWh), and a per-battery table (chemistry, state of charge, health/efficiency, and a status column flagging RUNAWAY, OVERHEAT, OFFLINE, or routine keep-warm states like WARMUP/COOLDOWN/WARM/COLD/SHUTDOWN). RUNAWAY blinks; a battery that's simultaneously overheating and shut down by the PCM alternates between OVERHEAT and OFFLINE instead of only showing one.
- Added "_overheat!_" PAW status.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed the low-power alarm's vessel autonomy estimate showing 100% reserve on a vessel whose batteries were all dead or thermally capped, since it was computed against the derated (shrunk-to-near-zero) capacity instead of the physical one.
- Fixed an overheat status (`Status` PAW field, and anything else reading it, e.g. MFD/CAS) getting stuck permanently after a PCM auto-shutdown, even once the battery had genuinely cooled back down.
- Fixed thermal wear accumulated from prolonged overheat (only reachable with the PCM disabled/bypassed) not being reflected in `BatteryHealth`/`StoredCharge` until the next charge or discharge cycle (a battery could appear undamaged and then suddenly jump to fully dead once that next cycle ran).

### Credits
- Thanks to forum user **Kvaksa** for the original suggestion behind the vessel-wide battery autonomy estimate, now live above.

## v3.3.4

### Minor Improvements
- **Initial MFD Extended compatibility**: RealBattery now ships its own bay page ("BATT") for [MFD Extension](https://github.com/Rjoande/MFD-Extension), the shared MAS multi-function-display add-on hosting a second, additive screen alongside a craft's existing IVA monitor. Currently a hello-world/verification page confirming the integration renders correctly end-to-end; the real vessel/fleet power readout (battery reserve, net EC rate, time to depletion, all already exposed via `RealBatteryPowerLedger`) follows in a later release. No effect on players without MFD Extended installed.

## v3.3.3

### Minor Improvements
- Removed a batch of leftover per-frame/per-physics-tick verbose log lines (visible only with the debug "Enable Verbose Logs" setting on) that spammed the log continuously during normal play.

## v3.3.2

### Minor Improvements
- Settings that depend on another setting (e.g. `Use SystemHeat` on `Use Thermal Simulation`, `EVA Refurbish` on `Battery Wear`) are now shown greyed-out and disabled when their dependency is off, instead of disappearing from the difficulty settings page entirely.
- New **Cosmetic messages** setting (difficulty settings, on by default): toggles the flavor-text toast messages for low-power warnings, reduced thermal capacity, and battery overheat all at once. Battery end-of-life and self-runaway warnings are always shown regardless, since those are serious events rather than spam. (The low-power toast previously had no working toggle at all — the check existed in code but was never wired up.)
- **`RealBatteryPowerLedger` (the read/report contract for third-party mods) reaches ContractVersion 3**, with five new read-only methods: `GetMaxEc`/`GetEffectiveMaxEc` (nominal vs. wear/thermal-derated capacity), `GetNetEcPerSecGross`/`GetNetEcPerSecTrue` (net vessel EC balance with/without solar, for a vessel that isn't currently loaded), and `GetNetEcPerSecLive`/`GetSecondsToEmpty` (true instantaneous rate and time-to-depletion for a loaded vessel). All vessel-wide aggregates are now backed by a single per-`FixedUpdate` cache on `RealBatteryLoadMaster` instead of a fresh walk of the vessel's parts on every call, so multiple consumers (RB's own tooling, RPM/MAS, other mods) share one computation. See `source/RealBatteryPowerLedger.md` for the full contract. *(For modders: no breaking changes — existing ContractVersion 1/2 method signatures are unchanged.)*

### Credits
- Thanks to forum user **Kvaksa** for the feedback behind two backlog items: the idea for a vessel-wide battery autonomy estimate (still planned, not yet in this release) and the request for a way to turn off the low-power/thermal/overheat toast spam, implemented above as the **Cosmetic messages** setting.

## v3.3.1

### Minor Improvements
- **`RB_ignore` opt-out marker:** parts that should never receive a RealBattery conversion (e.g. dedicated generator/reactor parts with `ElectricCharge` but no storage role) can now be excluded cleanly via a single ex-ante patch adding a marker `MODULE { name = RB_ignore }`, instead of the previous manual per-part workaround (adding a dummy `RealBattery` module, then removing it after RealBattery's patches ran). Every RealBattery-adding patch (stock, mod-support, and the generic catch-alls) now checks for this marker. See `patches/00_Ignore/RB_Ignore_List.cfg` and `library.md` for details. *(For modders: this is now the documented way to opt a third-party part out of RealBattery's auto-conversion.)*
- Universal Storage 2's `USEVAX` reactor part and Kerbal Foundries' `KF-APU` are now excluded via `RB_ignore` instead of the old dummy-module workaround.
- Fixed Bluedog Design Bureau's `bluedog_Ranger_Bus` never receiving a `RealBattery` module: the part's dedicated patch only added a `StoredCharge` resource to its `RangerB`/`MarinerB` mesh-style subtypes (a separate B9PartSwitch from RealBattery's own), leaving that capacity completely unmanaged (no discharge simulation, no wear, no PAW battery info). It now also receives the standard module via the collective Bluedog probe patch (`AgZn` chemistry); the mesh-style-specific resource block is unchanged and still needed for that switcher.

## v3.3.0

### Major Changes
- **RealBattery Expansion (new optional package):** the four exotic chemistries — *Vanadium Redox Flow (VRFB)*, *Liquid Metal (Mg‖Sb)*, *Superconducting (SMES)*, and *Long-lived Isotopic (Ho-166m)* — have been moved out of the core mod into a separate, fully removable **RealBatteryExpansion** package. The core mod now ships the 13 standard chemistries; install the Expansion to add the exotic tier. Each chemistry lives in its own self-contained folder (definitions, patches, localization, and assets), so the Expansion can be added or removed cleanly without affecting the core mod.
- New **Quantum Energy Teleportation** battery type added: similar to a SMES, but for smaller parts and uses additive C-rate scaling (see below).
- **Auxiliary resource flows (`RESOURCE_EXTRA`):** battery chemistries can now require or produce additional resources during charge or discharge. If an input resource runs short the transfer is blocked atomically: no EC or StoredCharge moves. *(For modders: supported in both `REALBATTERY_CHEMISTRY` nodes and legacy inline `MODULE` configs.)*
- **C-rate vessel scaling (`CrateScale`):** chemistries can opt into automatic C-rate scaling based on how many batteries of the same type are active on the vessel (`add` saturates towards a configurable multiplier, `reduce` decays smoothly towards zero — both level off instead of growing/collapsing without bound).
- **Bon Voyage compatibility:** Bon Voyage's rover autopilot can now see and drain RealBattery's `StoredCharge` correctly, either natively (pending a pull request to Bon Voyage /L) or, until that lands, via an optional `RealBatteryBVBridge.dll` companion plugin (requires HarmonyKSP, only active if both Bon Voyage and HarmonyKSP are installed). See the README for details. Replaces the old unofficial custom-DLL patch, which is now deprecated.
- **Power reporting contract for third-party mods (`RealBatteryPowerLedger`):** mods that track their own background/offline energy accounting (e.g. an autopilot driving a rover while the vessel is unloaded) can now report energy consumed back to RealBattery, which applies the `StoredCharge` drain, wear, and `BatteryLife` on their behalf — no need to know any of RealBattery's internals. See `source/RealBatteryPowerLedger.md` and the copy-paste `RealBatteryPowerLedgerWrapper.cs` template for integrators.

### Minor Improvements
- Fixed a memory leak: vessels that never entered physics range during a session (debris, unloaded craft, flags, etc.) left a dead `onVesselGoOffRails` event subscription behind on every scene change. Replaced with the native per-vessel `VesselModule` lifecycle hook, which makes the leak structurally impossible rather than patching around it.
- Fixed the staging toggle needing a vessel reload to take effect after switching chemistry/subtype, and a residual staging icon lingering after activation. Thermal (fixed-output) batteries now use a distinct staging icon from rechargeable batteries.
- Fixed an erroneous EVA upgrade path where **VRFB incorrectly upgraded into SMES**. Both are now standalone tiers, selected directly rather than reached by upgrade.
- The **Zebra → Mg‖Sb** EVA upgrade path is now provided by the Expansion, and is available only when it is installed (the core mod leaves Zebra as a terminal tier).
- Fixed a missing decal-label description on the **Mg‖Sb** battery (it referenced a non-existent text key).
- Reworked battery decal labels to use one texture per design instead of a shared texture atlas.
- Chemistry parameter defaults are now defined in a single place internally; the inline-config and chemistry-DB fallback sets previously diverged on a handful of thermal and wear fields.
- Fixed `Extra_AlternatorFix.cfg` incorrectly stripping the alternator from air-breathing engines (e.g. Juno) when DangIt is installed.
- Fixed the charge/discharge status flickering between Charging/Discharging/Idle on vessels with multiple batteries, caused by the vessel-wide power level hovering right at the charge/discharge threshold.
- Fixed the charge/discharge power readout taking up to several minutes to settle back to zero after a load stopped drawing power (worse on high-capacity batteries and low-framerate vessels); it now settles within a few seconds regardless of framerate or battery size.
- Fixed a broken Li_poly localization string.

### Compatibility Notes
- Existing saves remain compatible, and the Expansion can be installed alongside an existing RealBattery setup.
- **If you remove the Expansion**, parts currently using an exotic chemistry (VRFB / Mg‖Sb / SMES / Ho-166m) will lose those subtypes — keep the Expansion installed if your craft rely on them.

## v3.1.0

### Major Changes
- **SystemHeat integration:** overhauled heat flux management. RealBattery now correctly silences the SystemHeat loop when heat simulation is disabled, and reports the correct operating temperature target at all times.
- **TempOptimal:** each battery chemistry now declares an explicit SystemHeat loop target temperature (`TempOptimal`), independent of overheat/runaway thresholds. This allows finer thermal loop control per chemistry, improving compatibility with mixed-part loops and reducing unwanted thermal interactions.
- **Rebalanced** high-tier chemistry costs and energy density (EC/vol, SC/vol, Crate) to prevent out-of-scale values on large-volume parts and better align with late-game part costs.
- **Cryogenic Battery Rework:** SMES batteries now model superconductor physics more accurately. Shutting down an SMES drains its stored charge to zero as the cryocooler winds down; restarting requires recharging from an external source. Warmup and shutdown duration scale with battery volume (larger batteries take longer to reach operating temperature).
- **Cryo Waste Heat Mode** *(requires SystemHeat, opt-in)*: SMES and other cryo batteries can now model their cryocooler as a fixed SystemHeat waste heat source instead of consuming ElectricCharge for thermal upkeep, in line with CryoTanks' thermal model.
- **Part tooltip:** Single-chemistry battery parts now display the chemistry name, full description, and battery volume in the VAB/SPH editor.

### Minor Improvements
- Fixed battery state (Charging / Discharging / Idle) remaining stuck for extended periods after activity ceased.
- Fixed SystemHeat loop target dropping to 0 K when a battery was idle or disabled, causing the loop to cool artificially between charge cycles.
- Fixed low-power alarm triggering incorrectly for vessels with a positive energy balance (e.g. solar-powered probes in sunlight).
- Fixed primary cells blocking charging of all rechargeable batteries on mixed vessels, depending on part load order (regression since v2.0).
- Fixed the "Primary depleted" status incorrectly shown for InfiniteCycles batteries (e.g. SMES) when their charge reached zero.
- PCM (thermal cutoff) no longer fires on SMES and Thermal batteries.
- Batteries with higher resource priority now discharge first (and charge first), consistent with KSP's own resource flow convention. Also, discharge and charge priority ordering now uses C-rate as a tiebreaker when multiple batteries share the same Flow Priority and State of Charge, producing more consistent behavior.
- BDB easter egg chemistries (HgZn, AgCd) now have slightly adjusted Crate values to reflect their historical application context, and dedicated tooltips.
- Part `bluedog_Alouette_Core` now has correct chemistry (NiCd).
- Added new chemistry subsets to **Universal Storage 2** microsats.

## v3.0.2

- `GetInfo()` tooltip now shows a descriptive module summary and battery volume instead of potentially incorrect charge rate values.
- Fixed `\\n` artifacts in some localization file.
- Fixed `bluedog_solarBattery` subtypes list (AgOx -> AgZn).


## v3.0.1

- Fixed a number of parts not receiving the correct dedicated patch.
- Review of the autopatch filters, load order and subtypes.

## v3.0.0

### Major Changes

- **New battery chemistries**: four new chemistry types are now available across the tech tree:
  - *Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries (VRFB)*: high-capacity late-game option with virtually no degradation.
  - *Liquid Metal Batteries (Mg||Sb LMB)*: must be kept at operating temperature (~700 K) to function; suited for high-power industrial applications.
  - *Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES)*: must be kept cryogenic to operate; immune to cycle wear, but suffers reversible capacity loss if overheated.
  - *Long-lived Isotopic Cells (Ho-166m)*: radioisotope cells with a half-life measured in centuries, designed for interstellar missions; capacity degrades very slowly over time.
- **Chemistry database** (`Chemistries.cfg`): all battery chemistry parameters are now defined in a single centralized file, making it straightforward for modders to add custom chemistries without editing core files. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Rjoande/RealBattery/wiki) for the modding guide.
- **EVA Chemistry Upgrade**: Engineers on EVA can now upgrade a battery to the next chemistry tier (e.g. NiCd -> Li-ion) by consuming SpareParts. The upgrade resets battery wear. Required engineer level and SpareParts cost depend on the target chemistry.
- **Engineer level requirements**: EVA refurbishment and chemistry upgrades now require a minimum Engineer star level depending on the battery chemistry. Higher-tier chemistries require more experienced engineers.
- **Cryogenic KeepWarm mode**: the thermal upkeep system now handles both hot-side (warm) and cold-side (cryo) chemistries. SMES batteries must be actively cooled; PAW status reflects this with dedicated *cooling down* / *heating up* labels instead of the warm-chemistry equivalents.
- **SMES thermal cap**: if an SMES battery overheats above its operating threshold, its usable capacity is temporarily reduced proportionally to temperature. Capacity is fully restored once the battery cools down. A one-time inbox alert is generated when this occurs.
- **Background SelfRunaway notifications**: if an isotopic battery suffers a spontaneous meltdown while the vessel is unloaded, player will receive an inbox message on returning to that vessel.
- **Loading tips**: in-game loading screen tips are now included via *LoadingTipsPlus* (now bundled with RealBattery).
- Added support for [**Grounded**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/171377-110x-grounded-modular-vehicles-r50-mining-modules-rotor-emergency-light-jun-5-2019/).

### Minor Improvements

- Fixed a staging integration bug that could cause incorrect stage ordering in the editor. *Note: after updating, reload your vessel to see the staging icon correctly. See [Troubleshooting & FAQ](https://github.com/Rjoande/RealBattery/wiki/Troubleshooting-&-FAQ) for details.*
- Added *Disable background simulation* toggle in advanced settings (intended for debugging and troubleshooting).
- Added *Self-runaway in background* toggle in advanced settings: spontaneous meltdown events can now be independently disabled for unloaded vessels without affecting foreground behavior.
- Tech tree nodes reorganized for both stock and Community Tech Tree, to better reflect the progression of new chemistries.
- Rebuilt all *ConformalDecals* and tech tree icon textures from scratch in DDS format for improved visual quality and performance.
- General localization improvements.

### Compatibility Notes

- Existing saves are fully compatible. Chemistry parameters are not stored in save files.
- Third-party patches written for v2.x remain functional via the optional **RealBattery Legacy Configs** package (see included `HOW_TO_INSTALL.txt`).

---

## v2.3.2

- Added optional *Deep-space protection* setting to suppress float-charge wear during long unloaded deep-space transfers, preserving battery health without affecting normal charge behavior.
- Fixed tech-locked PAW fields always visible due to `moduleActive` UI override ignoring unlock conditions
- Integrated RealBattery settings with stock difficulty presets
- Fixed Bluedog's X-15 battery type (AgOx).

## v2.3.1

- Added support for Kopernicus Multistar systems (Kopernicus remains an optional dependency).
- Fixed PAW group name not displaying in some situations (Editor and/or Flight).
- Fixed loading issue when SystemHeat is not installed (no longer required to start).
- Revised Bluedog ProbeExpansions configs: battery types now match the historical chemistry of each probe, with a small easter egg included.

## v2.3.0

### Major Changes

- **Low-power battery alerts**: Enable automatic alarms (stock or KAC) and inbox messages when a vessel is about to run out of power. This *should* also apply to vessels already in flight before 2.3, but it's not guaranteed.
- **Optional Stock Heat Simulation**: batteries can now produce and handle heat using the stock thermal system if *SystemHeat* is disabled or not installed. This option is selectable in the difficulty settings. *SystemHeat is no longer a hard dependency*.
- **Staging integration**: all batteries can now be armed for activation via staging, with a dedicated toggle and staging icon.
- **Thermal batteries overhaul**: thermal batteries now start inactive by default, provide continuous fixed power output once activated, and cannot be turned off afterward.
- **New KERBA batteries**: inspired from Zebra Batteries, they require pre-heating before activation, continuous power (or loop heat) to stay warm, and a controlled cooldown when manually shut down.
- **Self-runaway logic**: added hourly chance (configurable) in Hafnium batteries for a spontaneous meltdown. 
- **Tech-locked UI fields**: certain telemetry and diagnostics readouts (SoC, Time-to-Depletion, Health) now require dedicated upgrades to be unlocked in _Career_ and _Science_ modes; in Sandbox they remain fully visible.
- **Automatic battery shutdown**: once the *Protection Circuit Module* is unlocked, batteries will automatically disable themselves if they overheat beyond their safe temperature threshold.
- **EVA Battery Refurbishment**: Engineers on EVA can now restore worn-out batteries using SpareParts resource from the vessel, with cost scaled by battery capacity.

### Minor Improvements

- *Day length* for background simulation is now auto-detected from the homeworld. You can override it in settings (0 = Auto, otherwise 1–24 h).
- Added *polar mode* for background simulation while landed near poles (configurable).
- *Thermal runaway model*: batteries now generate heat autonomously once their temperature exceeds `TempRunaway`, even if disabled. Heat output scales with chemistry (defaults to DischargeRate; optional `RunawayHeatKW` field per subtype).
- *Engineer Bonus*: engineer level slightly boosts discharge output and reduces heat & degradation (up to 25% better); slight malus (-5%) with no engineers on board.
- *Battery health* field now shows remaining cycles left for rechargeable batteries.
- When a cell’s health drops below 80%, a localized system message (contract-style inbox alert) is generated once per part.
- *DischargeRate* is now shown correctly in the editor, and automatically updates when switching to a different subtype.
- RealBattery PAW group is now automatically hidden when the current B9 subtype does not include an active battery module (`moduleActive = false`).  
- Reorganized *Difficulty Settings* into three tabs.
- Rebalanced subtype costs to better follow career progression.
- Custom models & textures for tech nodes.
- General code cleanup and refactoring.
- Improved some localization strings.

---

## v2.2.4

- Further improved background simulation for partial night/day cycles (both orbital and surface).
- Internal code cleanup.

## v2.2.3

- Fixed poor synthax for Module Manager patches, for enhanced compatibility with other mods (thanks to **JadeOfMaar**).
- Added **Simplified Chinese** localization (thanks to **Aebestach**).

## v2.2.2

- Fixed a bug that caused errors in Module Manager when adding *SystemHeat* support to certain third-party batteries (notably BDB, OPT, HabTech, and US2).

## v2.2.1

- Fixed a bug causing Battery Health to drop to 0% if the vessel had been tested in the editor before launch.
- Battery Wear no longer applies in the editor.
- Self-discharge in runtime now only applies to disabled batteries.
- Batteries are now properly reset at launch (WearCounter and Health).
- *SimulationMode* now defaults to "Idle" instead of showing "NotFound" in the editor PAW.
- Improved runtime logging and code reliability.
- Fixed broken strings and improved localization.

## v2.2.0

### Major Changes

- **Battery Toggle**: Each battery can now be manually enabled/disabled via the PAW or action groups.
- **Background Simulation**: Batteries now charge and discharge even when vessels are unloaded. Includes support for some third-party modules.
- **Battery Obsolescence**: Batteries wear down over time based on usage, reducing their maximum capacity.
- **Self-Discharge**: Idle batteries gradually lose charge over time.
- **Thermal Simulation**: Batteries now produce heat when charging/discharging and can suffer damage if overheated. *SystemHeat is now a hard dependency*.
- **Difficulty Settings**: A new menu lets you toggle features such as self-discharge, thermal simulation, and verbose logging.

### Minor Improvements

- Improved localization and corrected language strings.
- In the VAB/SPH, batteries now simulate their expected input/output based on selected Simulation Mode. This improves compatibility with *DynamicBatteryStorage* and *SystemHeat*.
- The PAW now shows additional data: estimated time to full charge/discharge, battery health and state of charge.

---

## v 2.1.0

### Major Changes

- Added C-rate as upper limit of charge/discharge rate (see the Wiki for details).
- Added **Kerb-O-Power** nuclear battery type.
- Added `moduleActive` field to hide RealBattery stats in non-battery subtypes.
- Restored blackline's fallback to avoid crash on game load whit incorrect .cfg

### Minor Improvements

- Fixed `StoredCharge` bar not showing in the PAW while in VAB/SPH (thanks to **JadeOfMaar** for suggestion).
- Fixed wrong description for Nichel batteries upgrade.
- Fixed battery type for BDB's Atlas A and Titan II reentry nosecones (Thermal).
- Rebalanced Thermal Battery stats.
- Added _"Battery Manager"_ PAW collapsable group.
- Improved descriptions.
